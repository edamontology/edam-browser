# EDAM Browser contribution guidelines

### Pull requests

The recommended way for contributors to submit code to EDAM Browser is to fork the repository on GitHub and then submit a pull request (PR) after committing the changes. The maintainers will then review the request before it is merged into the main branch.

Please make one PR per issue, solving multiple issues in the same PR make it harder to assess independently each solution and delay the moment changes can be merge.

No bulk reformatting, only reformat code that is already changed by the code you wrote when solving the issue you are addressing.

The contributed code will be [**licensed under EDAM Browser's license**](https://github.com/edamontology/edam-browser/blob/main/LICENSE).
If you did not write the code yourself, please ensure that the license is compatible, or obtain a permission from the original author to relicense the contributed code.
Please include license information in the contributed files. 


### Bug reports and feature requests

If you have encountered a problem with the EDAM Browser or would like to discuss a new feature or idea, please submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/edamontology/edam-browser/issues) on GitHub.

For bug reports, please provide the steps that led you to this bug, a screenshot of the glitch when relevant, the custom 
JSON ontology file used when relevant, and in general all the information which would help us reproduce the bug.
